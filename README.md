A collection of basic HTML projects to showcase my learning journey and the skills I've acquired. (I promise, this repo won't leave you feeling &lt;div>-ided!)

Each project focuses on different HTML elements and concepts, providing a comprehensive understanding of how to structure and style web pages.
